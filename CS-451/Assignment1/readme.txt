NOTES:
Make sure that the included headers file is in the same directory as the compiled code.
The headers file includes all functions used outside of main.

N/A
To the best of my knowlege, everything works as intended without error.
The only things not fully implemented are pretty printing and function aliasing, but these are not required.
