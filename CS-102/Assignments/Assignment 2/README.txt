ArrayList was chosen for MatchContainer because it integrates more seamlessly with the rest of my original code, allowing for lower chance of new bugs being created.

1. It's occurred to me that the only reason the score printing didn't work before is because there was a new line character at the end of matchScore.
Now that it's been removed, that issue has been fixed.
2. The input file gives many error messages because I was using it to test exception handling, not because of actual errors.
I would suggest that you give it a look.
3. This assignment was due Sun, Dec 6. It is currently Thurs, Dec 10.
