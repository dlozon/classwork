SpellCheck was written by Dylan Lozon
for project 2 of the Haskell portion of CS-231

------ Compiling Info ------
This project can be compiled with:
ghc Hangman.hs -o Hangman.out

------ Execution Info ------
After the file has been compiled,
you will need a file with a single
word in it. (If more than one word
is contained, only the first will be used)

To execute the program:
./Hangman.out <Secret Word File>
